#Red Ventures Coding Test

##npm install - 
to download all the dependencies

##npm run build - 
to run the build

##npm start - 
to start the server. Browse to localhost:5000

I have used webpack as module bundler and running express server. 

##Assumptions

1.I have added the search by name and id
2. As there were like 500 widgets I have created the pagination to show 25 widgets on the page with next and previous buttons. Previous buttons is not seen on the first page, but can be seen on subsequent pages.
3. For creating and updating the widget I have marked all the fields as required except the inventory as I am using 0 as default value. So if no selection 0 will be used.
4. Caution!!!! This is not responsive yet.
